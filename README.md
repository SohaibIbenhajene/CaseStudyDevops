# Devops &amp; Security Case Study: Maze Game

For the Case Study, I could choose between 3 different cases, a Windows Forms/ WPF App, 
a Webscraper or an ASP.NET web app. I chose a Windows Forms application with a SQLite 
Database. In the end, I chose to create a Maze Game. It's a small 2d game, where you have
move your cursor trough a difficult maze. You have a limited amount of lives and your 
time is also recorded. So, if you're fast you can land a nice spot on the leaderboard.
You can play the game [here.](https://github.com/SohaibIbenhajene/CaseStudyDevops/suites/9935260477/artifacts/480900084)

Game rules:
The game is very simple, first you can choose your difficulty and fill in your username. 
Once you click play you'll be placed inside the maze, you then have get to the end as fast 
as possible without touching the walls. If you touch a wall you'll be brought back to the 
beginning and lose a life. Depending on the difficulty you'll have more or less lives. 
Once you finish you'll be presented with a screen where you can see your score and also 
all the other highscores of other players.
